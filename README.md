# Phonebook
Mozilla's internal phonebook app.

## Installation
* Clone, host on a local, PHP-enabled server, run.
* Optional: `cp config-local.php-dist config-local.php` and tweak as needed

*Note:* The app requires LDAP server access. You probably need a [Mozilla-internal VPN connection](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/display/SD/VPN) up and running. Without, you can't currently develop on *Phonebook*.
